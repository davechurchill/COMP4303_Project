# Minecraft Project Feature Requirements

Here you will find a list of all the requirements for the Minecraft project. The goal of this project to create an entry for the [Generative Design in Minecraft Competition (GDMC)](https://gendesignmc.wikidot.com/wiki:2022-settlement-generation-competition). In 2020 [an entry by 3 students from COMP4303 (Troy, Ryan, and Trent) won the GDMC](https://gazette.mun.ca/student-life/3d-world-builders/) with their [self-titled entry](https://gendesignmc.wikidot.com/wiki:2020-settlement-generation-competition) - an excellent feature to add to a resume.

According to the GDMC website: "The Settlement Generation Challenge is about writing an algorithm that can create a settlement for a given, unknown Minecraft map. The challenge is to produce an algorithm that is adaptive towards the provided map, creates a settlement that satisfies a range of functional requirements - but also looks good and evokes an interesting narrative. The goal is to basically produce an algorithm that can rival the state of the art of what humans can produce"

The project should follow the [rules for the GDMC](https://gendesignmc.wikidot.com/wiki:2022-settlement-generation-competition), closely adhering to the 4 main judging criteria: Adaptivity, Functionality, Narraitive, and Aesthetics. I highly recommend watching the [2021 Winner Presentation Video](https://youtu.be/uYUIZUGPNX8) to become a little more familiar with the project before proceeding further, since it explains many of these concepts. You can also [watch some of the past student project video trailers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9VV-F9465U&list=PL_xRyXins849F8QIw5s1ID8FOR2cdPMzH&index=1) for inspiration.

As the judging criteria are quite abstract, in order to create a more concrete set of project requirements, you will find above a checklist of required functionality that I would like to see in your final project. Below is a more detailed explanation for each feature. You will also be required to choose a 'specialty' which will make your settlement unique from others.

## Chosen Specialty

- You are required to choose a specialty for your village that will make it stand out from others in a signficant way.
- Examples of specialties can be:
  - Heavy use of villagers, farms, or outdoor features
  - Advanced path-finding or building placement algorithms
  - Theme or style of decoration that heavily plays into narrative
  - Special large features or buildings 

## Adaptability

- Your settlement must adapt to the surrounding area that is chosen by the GDMC competition. It cannot simply taken any given input area, flatten it like a construction site, and then build on top of it
- You may flatten some areas in order to build the basis for a building, etc, but it must blend in naturally with the surroundings
- You must have 2 structures which are specifically adapted to specific terrain types. For example, maybe you have a fishing hut with a dock near the edge of the water, or a tree house when placed near a forest. There is a chance that a given location does not include these features, but your final project video must include examples where these are demonstrated
- You must contain 4 features which are biome-specific. For example, it doesn't make sense to make an igloo out of ice in the middle of a desert. Choose 4 biomes from the [list of all possible minecraft biomes](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360046470431-Minecraft-Types-of-Biomes) and demonstrate one feature or building that is specific to those biomes in your settlement. That feature MUST appear when you are in that biome, and cannot appear in other biomes. Your presentation should show off these features.
