# Minecraft Demo Instructions

For the project initial demo, you must record a narrated 3-5 minute video showing your project progress so far. I would like to see the following features implemented in the demo:

- Several types of structures implemented and being placed in world. Must have variable parameters so they are not always identical
- Cohesive town structure starting to form, some path ways or roads partially implemented
- Explain how you have tackled the 4 GDMC categories so far and what you have left to do
- Link to the video in the root project README.md file
- All of your code that was used to generate your settlement for the demo video should be in this folder

Notes: 
- This entire submission should be no more than a few megabytes at most. 
- Delete this folder if you are doing the Starcraft project
