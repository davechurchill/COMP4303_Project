# Starcraft Demo Instructions

For the project initial demo, you must record a narrated 3-5 minute video showing your project progress so far. I would like to see the following features implemented in the demo for each project type:

- Build-orders partially implemented with units being built toward a specific army goal
- Enemy base is scouted at the beginning of the match and successfully found
- An attack takes place on the enemy base, ideally doing some damage or winning a game
- Whatever your chosen area of specialization was should be partially implemented
- An explanation of how these things have been accomplished so far, and what features you have left to implement for the final project hand-in

This folder contains the following 3 directories:

```
bin/ 
  - must contain your compiled StarterBot.exe
  - must contain any additional files you need in your bin dir
  - do not include any visualstudio output debugging files such as .pdb files

src/ 
  - must contain your bot source code
  - copy all files from your STARTcraft windows/c++/src/ directory here

visualstudio/
  - must contain your visual studio project files
  - copy all files from your STARTcraft windows/c++/visualstudio/ directory here
  - delete all temporary output vs directories, they contain massive files
    - visualstudio/Release
    - visualstudio/Debug
    - visualstudio/.vs
```

This entire submission should be no more than a few megabytes at most. 
If it is any larger than this, please remove any unnecessary files listed above

Note: Delete this file and folder if you are not doing the Starcraft project
