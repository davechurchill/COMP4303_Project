# Starcraft Demo Instructions

For the project initial demo, you must record a narrated 3-5 minute video showing your project progress so far. I would like to see the following features implemented in the demo for each project type:

- Build-orders partially implemented with units being built toward a specific army goal
- Enemy base is scouted at the beginning of the match and successfully found
- An attack takes place on the enemy base, ideally doing some damage or winning a game
- Whatever your chosen area of specialization was should be partially implemented
- An explanation of how these things have been accomplished so far, and what features you have left to implement
- Link to the video in the root project README.md file

This folder contains the following 3 directories:

```
bin/ 
  - must contain your compiled StarterBot.exe
  - must contain any additional files you need in your bin dir
  - do not include any visualstudio output debugging files such as .pdb files

src/ 
  - must contain your bot source code

visualstudio/
  - must contain your visual studio project files
  - delete all temporary output vs directories, they contain massive files
    - visualstudio/Release
    - visualstudio/Debug
    - visualstudio/.vs
```

Simply copy your `bin`, `src`, and `visualstudio` directories from your STARTcraft project into this directory.

Notes: 
- This entire submission should be no more than a few megabytes at most. 
- Delete this folder if you are not doing the Starcraft project
